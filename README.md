# Parallel-Average-Square-POSIX-Threads

A C program to calculate the average of the squares of elements in an array using POSIX Threads. This program demonstrates parallel computation by dividing the task among multiple threads, each computing a portion of the sum.

## Features
- Calculates the average of the squares of elements in an array.
- Utilizes POSIX Threads for parallel computation.
- Customizable number of threads and array size.

## Requirements
- GCC (or any C compiler supporting POSIX threads)
- POSIX Threads library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/Parallel-Average-Square-POSIX-Threads.git
